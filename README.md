This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data using both **SQL** and **Power BI** to generate insights into key performance metrics.

## 📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **💰 Total Revenue**: The overall revenue generated from pizza sales.
- **🧾 Average Order Value**: The average amount spent per order.
- **🍕 Total Pizzas Sold**: The number of pizzas sold during the analysis period.
- **📦 Total Orders**: The total number of orders placed.
- **🍽️ Average Pizzas per Order**: The average number of pizzas per order.

## 📈 Analysis Performed

- **📅 Daily Trends for Total Orders**: SQL queries were used to track daily order trends.
- **📆 Monthly Trends for Total Orders**: Monthly analysis to understand peak periods.
- **📊 Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category**: Breakdown of sales by pizza type (e.g., veggie, meat, etc.).
- **📐 Sales by Pizza Size**: Insights into which pizza sizes (small, medium, large) perform the best.
- **🏅 Top 5 Best Sellers (Revenue, Quantity, Orders)**: SQL queries to identify the most popular pizzas.
- **📉 Bottom 5 Worst Sellers (Revenue, Quantity, Orders)**: SQL queries to pinpoint underperforming products.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL** for querying, data extraction, and aggregation.
- **Power BI** for data visualization, dashboard creation, and trend analysis.

## 🖼️ Visualizations

- **Daily Trends** for total orders using line graphs.
- **Monthly Sales Trends** to visualize order volume over time.
- **Sales Breakdown** by pizza category and size using pie charts and bar graphs.
- **Top/Bottom Sellers** visualized through bar charts.

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Analyze Sales Trends**: Identify daily and monthly trends in total orders and revenue to understand peak sales periods and customer behavior.
   
2. **Understand Product Performance**: Evaluate the performance of different pizza categories (e.g., veggie, meat, deluxe) and sizes (small, medium, large) to identify best- and worst-selling products.

3. **Optimize Business Operations**: Use insights from sales data to recommend inventory management strategies, menu optimizations, and promotional offers for underperforming items.

4. **Leverage SQL for Data Extraction**: Utilize SQL queries to efficiently retrieve, aggregate, and analyze data from the pizza sales database.

5. **Create Visual Representations**: Develop interactive visualizations in Power BI to showcase key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, top-selling pizzas, and daily sales trends.

6. **Support Data-Driven Decisions**: Provide actionable insights that will help improve marketing strategies, optimize pricing, and streamline operational efficiency in the pizza business.
